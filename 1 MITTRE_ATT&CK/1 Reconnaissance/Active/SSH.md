# SSH

# ðŸ“Œ Basic Information
- **Full Name:** Secure Shell Protocol
- **Abbreviation:** SSH
- **OSI Layer:** 7
- **Default Port(s):** 22
- **Protocol Type:** TCP

# ðŸ”Ž Description
[Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (`SSH`) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port `TCP 22`. 

There are two competing protocols: `SSH-1` and `SSH-2`.

`SSH-2`, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and securit y. For example, `SSH-1` is vulnerable to `MITM` attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not. OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:
1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

# ðŸ“¡ Use Cases
- Secure remote administration
- Secure file transfers throught tools like SCP or SFTP
- Encrypted tunneling and port forwarding

## Dangerous Settings
Despite the SSH protocol being one of the most secure protocols available today, some misconfigurations can still make the SSH server vulnerable to easy-to-execute attacks.

| **Setting**                  | **Description**                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `PasswordAuthentication yes` | Allows password-based authentication.       |
| `PermitEmptyPasswords yes`   | Allows the use of empty passwords.          |
| `PermitRootLogin yes`        | Allows to log in as the root user.          |
| `Protocol 1`                 | Uses an outdated version of encryption.     |
| `X11Forwarding yes`          | Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications. |
| `AllowTcpForwarding yes`     | Allows forwarding of TCP ports.             |
| `PermitTunnel`               | Allows tunneling.                           |
| `DebianBanner yes`           | Displays a specific banner when logging in. |

## Attack Vectors
1. Password authentication brute-force
2. Unprotected keys with bad permissions
## Enumeration
**Banner Grabbing**
We may encounter various banners for the SSH server during penetration tests. By default, the banners start with the version of the protocol that can be applied and then the version of the server itself. For example, with `SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1`, we know that we can use both protocol versions SSH-1 and SSH-2, and we are dealing with OpenSSH server version 3.9p1. On the other hand, for a banner with `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1`, we are dealing with an OpenSSH version 8.2p1 which only accepts the SSH-2 protocol version.
```bash
nc -vn <IP> 22
```

**SSH-Audit**
 One of the tools we can use to fingerprint the SSH server is [ssh-audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit).
 It checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit.git && cd ssh-audit
./ssh-audit.py <IP>
```

**Change Authentication Method**
```bash
ssh -v <username>@<IP>
ssh -v <username>@<IP> -o PreferredAuthentications=password
```
