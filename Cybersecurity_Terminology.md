### Crawling

`Crawling`, often called `spidering`, is the `automated process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web`. Similar to how a spider navigates its web, a web crawler follows links from one page to another, collecting information. These crawlers are essentially bots that use pre-defined algorithms to discover and index web pages, making them accessible through search engines or for other purposes like data analysis and web reconnaissance.
