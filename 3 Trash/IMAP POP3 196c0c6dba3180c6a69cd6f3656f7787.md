# IMAP / POP3

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) are standard protocols for retrieving emails from a mail server.

**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):**

- **Server-Side Management:** Emails remain on the server, allowing access from multiple devices.
- **Synchronization:** Changes (e.g., read/unread status, folder organization) are reflected across all connected devices.
- **Port:** Typically operates over `port 143`; encrypted connections use `port 993`.

**POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):**

- **Local Storage:** Emails are downloaded to a single device and usually removed from the server.
- **Single Device Access:** Access is limited to the device where emails are downloaded.
- **Port:** Operates over `port 110;` encrypted connections use `port 995`.

**Key Differences:**

- **Access:** IMAP supports multiple devices; POP3 is device-specific.
- **Email Management:** IMAP allows server-side organization; POP3 relies on local management.
- **Storage:** IMAP requires more server space; POP3 uses local storage.

## Dangerous Settings

Nevertheless, configuration options that were improperly configured 
could allow us to obtain more information, such as debugging the 
executed commands on the service or logging in as anonymous, similar to 
the FTP service. Most companies use third-party email providers such as 
Google, Microsoft, and many others. However, some companies still use 
their own mail servers for many different reasons. One of these reasons 
is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep in their own hands. 
Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the 
worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, 
which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of 
these configuration options include:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `auth_debug` | Enables all authentication debug logging. |
| `auth_debug_passwords` | This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged. |
| `auth_verbose` | Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons. |
| `auth_verbose_passwords` | Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated. |
| `auth_anonymous_username` | This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism. |

## **Footprinting the Service**

### cURL - Unencrypted Interaction

```bash
curl -k 'imaps://10.129.246.70' --user robin:robin -v
```

### **OpenSSL - TLS Encrypted Interaction**

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.246.70:imaps
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:pop3s
```
