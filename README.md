This repository serves as my personal notebook for cybersecurity and linux topics, including research, tools, techniques, and best practices. It is structured to provide organized and easily accessible documentation for reference and learning.

### **Key Principles for Structuring Headings**

- **`# One H1 per document`** → The main title, e.g., **`# DNS`**.
- **`## Use H2 for main categories`** → e.g., _**`## Basic Information`**_, _**`## Description`**_, _**`## Attack Vectors`**_.
- **`### Use H3 for sub-sections`** → e.g., _**`### Common DNS Records`**_ under _**`## DNS Records`**_.
- **`#### Use H4 for very detailed topics`** → e.g., _**`#### Example Apache Configuration`**_ under _**`### Virtual Hosts`**_.
