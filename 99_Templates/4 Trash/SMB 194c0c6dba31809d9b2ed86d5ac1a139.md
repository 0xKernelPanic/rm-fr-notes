# SMB

`SMB (Server Message Block)` is a network file-sharing protocol used for accessing shared files, printers, and resources over a network. It is predominantly found in Windows environments but is also supported by Unix/Linux via **`Samba`**.

### SMB Communication Ports

- **NetBIOS over SMB (Older Implementations):** Uses TCP **137, 138, 139**.
- **CIFS/SMB Direct (Modern Implementations):** `Uses TCP **445**`.

## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. 
However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves
 what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that 
case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring 
with them. Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an 
example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's 
employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual 
folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better 
organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the 
shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `browseable = yes` | Allow listing available shares in the current share? |
| `read only = no` | Forbid the creation and modification of files? |
| `writable = yes` | Allow users to create and modify files? |
| `guest ok = yes` | Allow connecting to the service without using a password? |
| `enable privileges = yes` | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID? |
| `create mask = 0777` | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files? |
| `directory mask = 0777` | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh` | What script needs to be executed on the user's login? |
| `magic script = script.sh` | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed? |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored? |

## **Footprinting the Service**

### Null Session Authentication

Attempt to list SMB shares without credentials:

```
smbclient -N -L //<FQDN/IP>
```

This may reveal available shares on the system.

### Connecting to a Specific SMB Share

```
smbclient //<FQDN/IP>/<share> -U <username>
```

Example (Anonymous Login):

```
smbclient //<FQDN/IP>/public -U ""
```

### Nmap

```
nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 139,445 <target>
```

List users:

```
nmap --script smb-enum-users -p 139,445 <target>
```

## RPCClient

`rpcclient` is a powerful tool for SMB enumeration and domain reconnaissance.

### Connecting to RPC Service

```
rpcclient -U "" <target>
```

(Use `-U "username%password"` for authenticated enumeration.)

### Common RPC Queries

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `srvinfo` | Get basic server information. |
| `enumdomains` | Enumerate available domains in the network. |
| `querydominfo` | Get domain, server, and user details. |
| `netshareenumall` | Enumerate all available shares. |
| `netsharegetinfo <share>` | Get information about a specific share. |
| `enumdomusers` | List all domain users. |
| `queryuser <RID>` | Get user details based on RID (Relative Identifier). |

### Enumerating Domain Users

Extract users from an SMB/RPC service:

```
rpcclient -U "" <target> -c "enumdomusers"
```

This will return usernames and **RIDs**, which can be used to get more details.

### Querying a Specific User

Once you have a **RID** from `enumdomusers`, extract more info:

```
rpcclient -U "" <target> -c "queryuser <RID>"
```

### Additional Enumeration with Enum4Linux

```
enum4linux -a <target>
```

This script performs extensive SMB and RPC enumeration on Windows and Samba systems.

## Useful Programs

### Impacket - samrdump.py

Used for querying the Security Account Manager (SAM) database remotely:

```
python3 samrdump.py <target>
```

### SMBMap

A tool for enumerating SMB shares and permissions:

```
smbmap -H <target>
```

### CrackMapExec

A powerful post-exploitation tool for SMB enumeration and credential validation:

```
crackmapexec smb <target>
```

## Exploitation Considerations

- **Anonymous Access:** Some shares allow guest access.
- **Password Spray Attacks:** Weak credentials may allow unauthorized access.
- **RID Cycling:** Extracting valid usernames and pivoting to brute-force authentication.
- **Accessing Sensitive Files:** Check shares for interesting files (credentials, config files, scripts, etc.).

## Defensive Measures

- Disable **Null Sessions** (`RestrictAnonymous = 1`).
- Restrict SMB access by implementing proper firewall rules.
- Enforce strong password policies and account lockouts.
- Regularly audit SMB shares for misconfigurations.
