# MSSQL

[Microsoft SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) (`MSSQL`) is Microsoft's SQL-based relational database management system. Unlike 
MySQL, which we discussed in the last section, MSSQL is closed source and was initially written to run on Windows operating systems. There are versions of MSSQL that will run on Linux and MacOS, but we will more likely come across MSSQL instances on targets running Windows. Default mssql `port is 1433/tcp`.

## MSSQL Clients

| [mssql-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/mssql-cli?view=sql-server-ver15) | [SQL Server PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell?view=sql-server-ver15) | [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) | [SQLPro](https://www.macsqlclient.com/) | [Impacket's mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Of the MSSQL clients listed above, pentesters may find Impacket's [mssqlclient.py](http://mssqlclient.py/) to be the most useful due to SecureAuthCorp's Impacket project being present on many pentesting distributions at install. To find if and where the client is located on our host, we can use the following command:

## Default Configuration

When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`.
 Connecting from the client-side is possible through Windows 
Authentication, and by default, encryption is not enforced when 
attempting to connect.

## **Dangerous Settings**

This is not an extensive list because there are countless ways MSSQL 
databases can be configured by admins based on the needs of their 
respective organizations. We may benefit from looking into the 
following:

- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
- The use of [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/configuration-manager/named-pipes-properties?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Weak & default `sa` credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account

## **Footprinting the Service**

### Nmap

We can see the `hostname`, `database instance name`, `software version of MSSQL` and `named pipes are enabled`. We will benefit from adding these discoveries to our notes.

```bash
sudo nmap --script ms-sql-info,ms-sql-empty-password,ms-sql-xp-cmdshell,ms-sql-config,ms-sql-ntlm-info,ms-sql-tables,ms-sql-hasdbaccess,ms-sql-dac,ms-sql-dump-hashes --script-args mssql.instance-port=1433,mssql.username=sa,mssql.password=,mssql.instance-name=MSSQLSERVER -sV -p 1433 10.129.201.248
```

### Metasploit

We can also use Metasploit to run an auxiliary scanner called `mssql_ping` that will scan the MSSQL service and provide helpful information in our footprinting process.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/mssql/mssql_ping) > set rhosts 10.129.201.248
```

### **Mssqlclient**

If we can guess or gain access to credentials, this allows us to remotely connect to the MSSQL server.

```bash
python3 mssqlclient.py Administrator@10.129.201.248 -windows-auth

```
