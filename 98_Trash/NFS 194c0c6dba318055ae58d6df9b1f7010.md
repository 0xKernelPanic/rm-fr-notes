# NFS

`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file 
system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. 
Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were 
local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)
 is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients 
cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet 
standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While
 NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

**Dangerous Settings**

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `rw` | Read and write permissions. |
| `insecure` | Ports above 1024 will be used. |
| `nohide` | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0. |

## **Footprinting the Service**
**nmap**

```bash
sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049
```

**Show Available NFS Shares**

```bash
showmount -e <target_IP>
```

**Mounting NFS Share**

```bash
mkdir target-NFS
sudo mount -t nfs <target_IP>:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
cd target-NFS
tree .
```
